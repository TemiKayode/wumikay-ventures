# Security Policy

## 🔐 Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- All sensitive data (API keys, database URLs) are stored in environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.local` for local development

### 2. Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- User authentication required for all database operations
- Input validation and sanitization on all queries

### 3. API Security
- Supabase handles authentication and authorization
- All API calls use HTTPS
- No sensitive data in client-side code

### 4. Input Validation
- All form inputs are validated
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper data handling

### 5. Authentication
- Secure user authentication through Supabase Auth
- Session management handled by Supabase
- No hardcoded credentials

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
2. **Validate inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update npm packages
5. **Review code**: Always review code for security vulnerabilities

### For Deployment
1. **Environment variables**: Set all required environment variables
2. **HTTPS only**: Ensure all traffic uses HTTPS
3. **Regular updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated
4. **Monitor logs**: Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
5. **Backup data**: Regular database backups
